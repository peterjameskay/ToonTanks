A great template for anyone looking to create a tower defense based game where all of the configuration of combat, sound effects, meshes, and others are all set up for you. Feel free to use this to create your own levels. Enjoy the added effects like smoke trails, sound effects and camera shakes that you can use for your own version of Toon Tanks.
